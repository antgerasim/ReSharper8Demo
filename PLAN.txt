Take this plan and pull it to your second (sixth?) monitor to follow.

Order of demos:

0. MAKE SURE TO REVERT TO LATEST GIT COMMIT!!!!!!
   - Otherwise, you're showing a demo with some changes you made earlier - not good

1. CODE COMPLETION ===================================================================
   BASIC COMPLETION
   - Open Imports.txt
   - Make the class extend inpc, show how import is now part of ordinary completion
   - Enter a type name 'Provi' inside the class and explain this works for types too
   - Create List<string> names = in the class, and note how basic completion has a smart item for
     collection initialization

   DOUBLE SMART COMPLETION
   - Navigate to Person.cs
   - Make a new method and write string s = this.| (too many items, some inapplicable)
   - Invoke Smart Completion (only items assignable to a string) -- what about Age?
   - Now press it again! Explain double completion.
   - Show that this is infinite.

   DOUBLE IMPORT COMPLETION
   - Navigate to FunTests.cs
   - Inside the method, use Button type, press Ctrl+Space, no suggestions :)
   - Now press Ctrl+Space again, choose Forms, explain what's happening.

   PRIVATE MEMBERS IN DOUBLE COMPLETION
   - Navigate to Manager type
   - Create some method that takes a Person
   - Invoke completion on parameter, then invoke it again and explain where 'id' came from.
   - Complete and quick-fix the field.

   CAST COMPLETION
   - Change parameter type to object
   - Explain that the typical op is if (p is Person)
   - Show double completion on p and how that value is cast.

   SENDER COMPLETION
   - Jump to MainForm visual editor
   - Double-click the button to create an event handler
   - Invoke double completion on sender, explain what's happening (e.g., Visible = false)
   
   GENERATIVE COMPLETION
   - Navigate to Person
   - Show 'override'
   - Explain ctorf, ctorp, ctorfp constructors
   
   FORMATTING COMPLETION
   - Create some method, don't matter which
   - Show DateTime.Now.ToString("|") completion
   - Show completion for a known type like double or Guid.
   - Show completion in string.Format("{0:|}", d) when d is a decimal. Note that you can create this from "|" via a CA.
